    <para>By default a Windows SMB server prevents directory
    renames when there are open file or directory handles below
    it in the filesystem hierarchy. Historically Samba has always
    allowed this as POSIX filesystem semantics require it.</para>

    <para>This boolean parameter allows Samba to match the Windows
    behavior. Setting this to "yes" is a very expensive change,
    as it forces Samba to travers the entire open file handle
    database on every directory rename request. In a clustered
    Samba system the cost is even greater than the non-clustered
    case.</para>

    <para>When set to "no" smbd only checks the local process
    the client is attached to for open files below a directory
    being renamed, instead of checking for open files across all
    smbd processes.</para>

    <para>Because of the expense in fully searching the database,
    the default is "no", and it is recommended to be left that way
    unless a specific Windows application requires it to be changed.</para>

    <para>If the client has requested UNIX extensions (POSIX
    pathnames) then renames are always allowed and this parameter
    has no effect.</para>
