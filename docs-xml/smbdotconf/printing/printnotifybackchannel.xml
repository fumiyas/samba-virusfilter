<para>Windows print clients can update print queue status by expecting
	the server to open a backchannel SMB connection to them. Due to
	client firewall settings this can cause considerable timeouts
	and will often fail, as there is no guarantee the client is even
	running an SMB server. By default, the Samba print server will
	not try to connect back to clients, and will treat corresponding
	requests as if the connection back to the client failed.
