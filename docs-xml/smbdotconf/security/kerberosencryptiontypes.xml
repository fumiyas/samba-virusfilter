    <para>This parameter determines the encryption types to use when operating
    as a Kerberos client. Possible values are <emphasis>all</emphasis>,
    <emphasis>strong</emphasis>, and <emphasis>legacy</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>Samba uses a Kerberos library (MIT or Heimdal) to obtain Kerberos
    tickets. This library is normally configured outside of Samba, using
    the krb5.conf file. This file may also include directives to configure
    the encryption types to be used. However, Samba implements Active Directory
    protocols and algorithms to locate a domain controller. In order to
    force the Kerberos library into using the correct domain controller,
    some Samba processes, such as
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>winbindd</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>net</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>, build a private krb5.conf
    file for use by the Kerberos library while being invoked from Samba.
    This private file controls all aspects of the Kerberos library operation,
    and this parameter controls how the encryption types are configured
    within this generated file, and therefore also controls the encryption
    types negotiable by Samba.
    </para>

    <para>When set to <constant>all</constant>, all active directory
    encryption types are allowed.
    </para>

    <para>When set to <constant>strong</constant>, only AES-based encyption
    types are offered. This can be used in hardened environments to prevent
    downgrade attacks.
    </para>

    <para>When set to <constant>legacy</constant>, only RC4-HMAC-MD5
    is allowed. Avoiding AES this way has one a very specific use.
    Normally, the encryption type is negotiated between the peers.
    However, there is one scenario in which a Windows read-only domain
    controller (RODC) advertises AES encryption, but then proxies the
    request to a writeable DC which may not support AES encryption,
    leading to failure of the handshake. Setting this parameter to
    <constant>legacy</constant> would cause samba not to negotiate AES
    encryption. It is assumed of course that the weaker legacy
    encryption types are acceptable for the setup.
