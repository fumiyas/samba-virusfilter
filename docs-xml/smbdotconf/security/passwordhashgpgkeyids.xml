	<para>If <command moreinfo="none">samba</command> is running as an
	active directory domain controller, it is possible to store the
	cleartext password of accounts in a PGP/OpenGPG encrypted form.</para>

	<para>You can specify one or more recipients by key id or user id.
	Note that 32bit key ids are not allowed, specify at least 64bit.</para>

	<para>The value is stored as 'Primary:SambaGPG' in the
	<command moreinfo="none">supplementalCredentials</command> attribute.</para>

	<para>As password changes can occur on any domain controller,
	you should configure this on each of them. Note that this feature is currently
	available only on Samba domain controllers.</para>

	<para>This option is only available if <command moreinfo="none">samba</command>
	was compiled with <command moreinfo="none">gpgme</command> support.</para>

	<para>You may need to export the <command moreinfo="none">GNUPGHOME</command>
	environment variable before starting <command moreinfo="none">samba</command>.
	<emphasis>It is strongly recommended to only store the public key in this
	location. The private key is not used for encryption and should be
	only stored where decryption is required.</emphasis></para>

	<para>Being able to restore the cleartext password helps, when they need to be imported
	into other authentication systems later (see <command moreinfo="none">samba-tool user getpassword</command>)
	or you want to keep the passwords in sync with another system, e.g. an OpenLDAP server
	(see <command moreinfo="none">samba-tool user syncpasswords</command>).</para>

	<para>While this option needs to be configured on all domain controllers, the
	<command moreinfo="none">samba-tool user syncpasswords</command> command should
	run on a single domain controller only (typically the PDC-emulator).</para>
