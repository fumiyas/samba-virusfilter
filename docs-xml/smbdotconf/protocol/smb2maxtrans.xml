<para>This option specifies the protocol value that <citerefentry><refentrytitle>smbd</refentrytitle>
<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will return to a client, informing the client of the largest
size of buffer that may be used in querying file meta-data via QUERY_INFO and related SMB2 calls.
</para>
<para>The maximum is 8388608 bytes (8MiB), which is the same as a Windows Server 2012 r2.</para>
<para>Please note that the default is 8MiB, but it's limit is based on the
smb2 dialect (64KiB for SMB == 2.0, 1MiB for SMB >= 2.1 with LargeMTU).
Large MTU is not supported over NBT (tcp port 139).</para>
