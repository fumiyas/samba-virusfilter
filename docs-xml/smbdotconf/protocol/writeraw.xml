<description>
    <para>This is ignored if <smbconfoption name="async smb echo handler"/> is set,
    because this feature is incompatible with raw write SMB requests</para>

    <para>If enabled, raw writes allow writes of 65535 bytes in 
    one packet. This typically provides a major performance benefit for some very, very old clients.
    </para>

    <para>However, some clients either negotiate the allowable 
    block size incorrectly or are incapable of supporting larger block 
	sizes, and for these clients you may need to disable raw writes.</para>

<para>In general this parameter should be viewed as a system tuning 
	tool and left severely alone.</para>
