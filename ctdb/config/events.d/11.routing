# Attempt to add a set of static routes.
#
# Do this in "ipreallocated" rather than just "startup" because some
# of the routes might be missing because the corresponding interface
# has not previously had any IPs assigned or IPs were previously
# released and corresponding routes were dropped.
#
# Addition of some routes might fail, errors go to /dev/null.
#
# Routes to add are defined in $CTDB_BASE/static-routes. Syntax is:
#
# IFACE NET/MASK GATEWAY
#
# Example:
#
# bond1 10.3.3.0/24 10.0.0.1
