eventscript unit tests
======================

This directory contains some eventscript unit tests for CTDB.  These
tests can be run as a non-privileged user.  There are a lot of stub
implementations of commands (located in stubs/) used to make the
eventscripts think they're running against a real system.

Test case filenames look like:

  <eventscript>.<event>.NNN.sh

The test helper functions will run <eventscript> with specified
options.  If using the simple_test() helper function then the 1st
<event> argument is automatically passed.  When simple_test_event() is
used the event name must be explicitly passed as the 1st argument -
this is more flexible and supports multiple events per test.

Examples:

* ../run_tests.sh .

  Run all tests, displaying minimal output.

* ../run_tests.sh -s .

  Run all tests, displaying minimal output and a summary.

* ../run_tests.sh -s ./10.interface.*.sh

  Run all the tests against the 10.interface eventscript.

* ../run_tests.sh -v -s .

  Run all tests, displaying extra output and a summary.

* ../run_tests.sh -sq .

  Run all tests, displaying only a summary.

* ../run_tests.sh -X ./10.interface.startup.002.sh

  Run a test and have the eventscript itself run with "sh -x".  This
  will usually make a test fail because the (undesirable) trace output
  will be included with the output of the eventscript.  However, this
  is useful for finding out why a test might be failing.
