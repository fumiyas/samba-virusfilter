Verify that 'ctdb ip' shows the correct output.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Run 'ctdb ip' on one of the nodes and verify the list of IP
   addresses displayed (cross check the result with the output of
   'ip addr show' on the node).
3. Verify that pipe-separated output is generated with the -X option.

Expected results:

* 'ctdb ip' shows the list of public IPs being served by a node.
