Verify that 'ctdb process-exists' shows correct information.

The implementation is creative about how it gets PIDs for existing and
non-existing processes.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. On one of the cluster nodes, get the PID of an existing process
   (using ps wax).
3. Run 'ctdb process-exists <pid>' on the node and verify that the
   correct output is shown.
4. Run 'ctdb process-exists <pid>' with a pid of a non-existent
   process and verify that the correct output is shown.

Expected results:

* 'ctdb process-exists' shows the correct output.
