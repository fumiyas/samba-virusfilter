Recovery can under certain circumstances lead to old record copies
resurrecting: Recovery selects the newest record copy purely by RSN. At
the end of the recovery, the recovery master is the dmaster for all
records in all (non-persistent) databases. And the other nodes locally
hold the complete copy of the databases. The bug is that the recovery
process does not increment the RSN on the recovery master at the end of
the recovery. Now clients acting directly on the Recovery master will
directly change a record's content on the recmaster without migration
and hence without RSN bump.  So a subsequent recovery can not tell that
the recmaster's copy is newer than the copies on the other nodes, since
their RSN is the same. Hence, if the recmaster is not node 0 (or more
precisely not the active node with the lowest node number), the recovery
will choose copies from nodes with lower number and stick to these.

Steps:

1. Create a test database
2. Add a record with value value1 on recovery master
3. Force a recovery
4. Update the record with value value2 on recovery master
5. Force a recovery
6. Fetch the record

Expected results:

* The record should have value value2 and not value1
