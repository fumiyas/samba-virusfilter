Verify that CIFS connections are monitored and that CIFS tickles are sent.

We create a connection to the CIFS server on a node and confirm that
this connection is registered by CTDB.  Then disable the relevant CIFS
server node and ensure that the takeover node sends an appropriate
reset packet.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 nodes with public addresses.

* Test must be run on a real or virtual cluster rather than against
  local daemons.

* Test must not be run from a cluster node.

* Clustered Samba must be listening on TCP port 445.

Expected results:

* CTDB should correctly record the connection and the takeover node
  should send a reset packet.
