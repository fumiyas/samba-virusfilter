Verify that NFS connections are monitored and that NFS tickles are sent.

We create a connection to the NFS server on a node and confirm that
this connection is registered in the nfs-tickles/ subdirectory in
shared storage.  Then kill ctdbd on the relevant NFS server node and
ensure that the takeover node sends an appropriate reset packet.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 nodes with public addresses.

* Test must be run on a real or virtual cluster rather than against
  local daemons.

* Test must not be run from a cluster node.

* Cluster nodes must be listening on the NFS TCP port (2049).

Expected results:

* CTDB should correctly record the socket and on failover the takeover
  node should send a reset packet.
