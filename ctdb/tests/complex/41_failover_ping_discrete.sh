Verify that it is possible to ping a public address after disabling a node.

We ping a public IP, disable the node hosting it and then ping the
public IP again.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 nodes with public addresses.

* Test must be run on a real or virtual cluster rather than against
  local daemons.

* Test must not be run from a cluster node.

Steps:

1. Verify that the cluster is healthy.
2. Select a public address and its corresponding node.
3. Send a single ping request packet to the selected public address.
4. Disable the selected node.
5. Send another single ping request packet to the selected public address.

Expected results:

* When a node is disabled the public address fails over and the
  address is still pingable.
