# Additional informations for DNS setup using BIND

# If you are running a capable version of BIND and you wish to support
# secure GSS-TSIG updates, you must make the following configuration
# changes:

#
# Steps for BIND 9.8.x and 9.9.x -----------------------------------------
#

# 1. Insert following lines into the options {} section of your named.conf 
#    file:
tkey-gssapi-keytab "${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}";

# 2. If SELinux is enabled, ensure that all files have the appropriate 
#    SELinux file contexts.  The ${DNS_KEYTAB} file must be accessible by the 
#    BIND daemon and should have a SELinux type of named_conf_t.  This can be 
#    set with the following command:
chcon -t named_conf_t ${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}

#    Even if not using SELinux, do confirm (only) BIND can access this file as the 
#    user it becomes (generally not root).

#
# Steps for BIND 9.x.x using BIND9_DLZ ------------------------------
#

# 3. Disable chroot support in BIND.  
#    BIND is often configured to run in a chroot, but this is not
#    compatible with access to the dns/sam.ldb files that database
#    access and updates require.  Additionally, the DLZ plugin is
#    linked to a large number of Samba shared libraries and loads
#    additonal plugins.

#
# Steps for BIND 9.x.x using BIND9_FLATFILE ------------------------------
#

# 3. Ensure the BIND zone file(s) that will be dynamically updated are in 
#    a directory where the BIND daemon can write.  When BIND performs 
#    dynamic updates, it not only needs to update the zone file itself but 
#    it must also create a journal (.jnl) file to track the dynamic updates 
#    as they occur.  Under Fedora 9, the /var/named directory can not be 
#    written to by the "named" user.  However, the directory /var/named/dynamic 
#    directory does provide write access.  Therefore the zone files were 
#    placed under the /var/named/dynamic directory.  The file directives in 
#    both example zone statements at the beginning of this file were changed 
#    by prepending the directory "dynamic/".
