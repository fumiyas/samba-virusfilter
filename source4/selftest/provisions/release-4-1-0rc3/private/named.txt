# Additional informations for DNS setup using BIND

# If you are running a capable version of BIND and you wish to support
# secure GSS-TSIG updates, you must make the following configuration
# changes:

#
# Steps for BIND 9.8.x and 9.9.x -----------------------------------------
#

# 1. Insert following lines into the options {} section of your named.conf
#    file:
tkey-gssapi-keytab "/data/samba/git/samba4.1/st/promoted_dc/private/dns.keytab";

#
# Common Steps for BIND 9.x.x --------------------------------------------
#

# 2. Set appropriate ownership and permissions on the dns.keytab file.
#    Note that the most distributions have BIND configured to run under a
#    non-root user account.  For example, Fedora 9 runs BIND as the user
#    "named" once the daemon relinquishes its rights.  Therefore, the file
#    dns.keytab must be readable by the user that BIND run as.  If BIND
#    is running as a non-root user, the "dns.keytab" file must have its
#    permissions altered to allow the daemon to read it.  Under Fedora 9,
#    execute the following commands:
chgrp named /data/samba/git/samba4.1/st/promoted_dc/private/dns.keytab
chmod g+r /data/samba/git/samba4.1/st/promoted_dc/private/dns.keytab

# 3. Ensure the BIND zone file(s) that will be dynamically updated are in
#    a directory where the BIND daemon can write.  When BIND performs
#    dynamic updates, it not only needs to update the zone file itself but
#    it must also create a journal (.jnl) file to track the dynamic updates
#    as they occur.  Under Fedora 9, the /var/named directory can not be
#    written to by the "named" user.  However, the directory /var/named/dynamic
#    directory does provide write access.  Therefore the zone files were
#    placed under the /var/named/dynamic directory.  The file directives in
#    both example zone statements at the beginning of this file were changed
#    by prepending the directory "dynamic/".

# 4. If SELinux is enabled, ensure that all files have the appropriate
#    SELinux file contexts.  The dns.keytab file must be accessible by the
#    BIND daemon and should have a SELinux type of named_conf_t.  This can be
#    set with the following command:
chcon -t named_conf_t /data/samba/git/samba4.1/st/promoted_dc/private/dns.keytab
