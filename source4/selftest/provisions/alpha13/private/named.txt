# Additional informations for DNS setup using BIND

# If you are running a capable version of BIND and you wish to support secure
# GSS-TSIG updates, you must make the following configuration changes:

# - Insert the following lines into the options {} section of your named.conf
# file:
tkey-gssapi-credential "DNS/alpha13.samba.corp";
tkey-domain "ALPHA13.SAMBA.CORP";

# - Modify BIND init scripts to pass the location of the generated keytab file.
# Fedora 8 & later provide a variable named KEYTAB_FILE in /etc/sysconfig/named
# for this purpose:
KEYTAB_FILE="/home/mat/workspace/samba/alpha13/private/dns.keytab"
# Note that the Fedora scripts translate KEYTAB_FILE behind the scenes into a
# variable named KRB5_KTNAME, which is ultimately passed to the BIND daemon.  If
# your distribution does not provide a variable like KEYTAB_FILE to pass a
# keytab file to the BIND daemon, a workaround is to place the following line in
# BIND's sysconfig file or in the init script for BIND:
export KRB5_KTNAME="/home/mat/workspace/samba/alpha13/private/dns.keytab"

# - Set appropriate ownership and permissions on the dns.keytab file.  Note
# that most distributions have BIND configured to run under a non-root user
# account.  For example, Fedora 9 runs BIND as the user "named" once the daemon
# relinquishes its rights.  Therefore, the file dns.keytab must be readable
# by the user that BIND run as.  If BIND is running as a non-root user, the
# "dns.keytab" file must have its permissions altered to allow the daemon to
# read it.  Under Fedora 9, execute the following commands:
chgrp named /home/mat/workspace/samba/alpha13/private/dns.keytab
chmod g+r /home/mat/workspace/samba/alpha13/private/dns.keytab

# - Ensure the BIND zone file(s) that will be dynamically updated are in a
# directory where the BIND daemon can write.  When BIND performs dynamic
# updates, it not only needs to update the zone file itself but it must also
# create a journal (.jnl) file to track the dynamic updates as they occur.
# Under Fedora 9, the /var/named directory can not be written to by the "named"
# user.  However, the directory /var/named/dynamic directory does provide write
# access.  Therefore the zone files were placed under the /var/named/dynamic
# directory.  The file directives in both example zone statements at the
# beginning of this file were changed by prepending the directory "dynamic/".

# - If SELinux is enabled, ensure that all files have the appropriate SELinux
# file contexts.  The dns.keytab file must be accessible by the BIND daemon
# and should have a SELinux type of named_conf_t.  This can be set with the
# following command:
chcon -t named_conf_t /home/mat/workspace/samba/alpha13/private/dns.keytab
