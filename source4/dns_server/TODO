DNS server todo list
--------------------

Just so we don't forget the required features for an AD-compatible DNS server:

- Symmetric Bind-style TKEY handling (not strictly needed for AD, but needed for
  integration to other name servers / tools)
(- Command line tools that unix admins are used to)
- Zone transfer support (XFER, IFER) (look at AD for permission settings)
- Caching
- dynamic zone reloading
- Tests, tests, tests
