# It may be useful at some point to allow Samba to build against a
# system libwbclient, such as the one provided by Likewise.  To to
# this, not only must the check below be activated but this must only
# be activated with an off-by-default option to disable the internal
# build of both winbindd implementations, and all the internal
# references to libwbclient.h will need to be fixed to point at the
# system libwbclient.  Finally, as a system libwbclient would probably
# not use the same version scheme as Samba, so this would need to
# reference Likewise version numbers instead.
