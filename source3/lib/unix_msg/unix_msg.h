 *
 * @brief Send large messages over unix domain datagram sockets
 *
 * A unix_msg_ctx represents a unix domain datagram socket.
 *
 * Unix domain datagram sockets have some unique properties compared with UDP
 * sockets:
 *
 * - They are reliable, i.e. as long as both sender and receiver are processes
 *   that are alive, nothing is lost.
 *
 * - They preserve sequencing
 *
 * Based on these two properties, this code implements sending of large
 * messages. It aims at being maximally efficient for short, single-datagram
 * messages. Ideally, if the receiver queue is not full, sending a message
 * should be a single syscall without malloc. Receiving a message should also
 * not malloc anything before the data is shipped to the user.
 *
 * If unix_msg_send meets a full receive buffer, more effort is required: The
 * socket behind unix_msg_send is not pollable for POLLOUT, it will always be
 * writable: A datagram socket can send anywhere, the full queue is a property
 * of of the receiving socket. unix_msg_send creates a new unnamed socket that
 * it will connect(2) to the target socket. This unnamed socket is then
 * pollable for POLLOUT. The socket will be writable when the destination
 * socket's queue is drained sufficiently.
 *
 * If unix_msg_send is asked to send a message larger than fragment_size, it
 * will try sending the message in pieces with proper framing, the receiving
 * side will reassemble the messages.
 *
 * fd-passing is supported.
 * Note that by default the fds passed to recv_callback are closed by
 * the receive handler in order to avoid fd-leaks. If the provider of
 * the recv_callback wants to use a passed file descriptor after the
 * callback returns, it must copy the fd away and set the corresponding
 * entry in the "fds" array to -1.
