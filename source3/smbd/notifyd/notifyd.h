/*
 * Filechangenotify based on asynchronous messages
 *
 * smbds talk to local notify daemons to inform them about paths they are
 * interested in. They also tell local notify daemons about changes they have
 * done to the file system. There's two message types from smbd to
 * notifyd. The first is used to inform notifyd about changes in notify
 * interest. These are only sent from smbd to notifyd if the SMB client issues
 * FileChangeNotify requests.
 */

/*
 * The notifyd implementation is designed to cope with multiple daemons taking
 * care of just a subset of smbds. The goal is to minimize the traffic between
 * the notify daemons. The idea behind this is a samba/ctdb cluster, but it
 * could also be used to spread the load of notifyd instances on a single
 * node, should this become a bottleneck. The following diagram illustrates
 * the setup. The numbers in the boxes are node:process ids.
 *
 *         +-----------+                  +-----------+
 *         |notifyd 0:5|------------------|notifyd 1:6|
 *         +-----------+                  +-----------+
 *            / |  \                         /    \
 *           /  |   \                       /      \
 *   +--------+ | +--------+        +--------+   +--------+
 *   |smbd 0:1| | |smbd 0:4|        |smbd 1:7|   |smbd 1:2|
 *   +--------+ | +--------+        +--------+   +--------+
 *              |
 *     	   +---------+
 *	   |smbd 0:20|
 *	   +---------+
 *
 * Suppose 0:1 and 0:4 are interested in changes for /foo and 0:20 creates the
 * file /foo/bar, if everything fully connected, 0:20 would have to send two
 * local messages, one to 0:1 and one to 0:4. With the notifyd design, 0:20
 * only has to send one message, it lets notifyd 0:5 do the hard work to
 * multicast the change to 0:1 and 0:4.
 *
 * Now lets assume 1:7 on the other node creates /foo/baz. It tells its
 * notifyd 1:6 about this change. All 1:6 will know about is that its peer
 * notifyd 0:5 is interested in the change. Thus it forwards the event to 0:5,
 * which sees it as if it came from just another local event creator. 0:5 will
 * multicast the change to 0:1 and 0:4. To prevent notify loops, the message
 * from 1:6 to 0:5 will carry a "proxied" flag, so that 0:5 will only forward
 * the event to local clients.
