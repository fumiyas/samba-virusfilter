INSTRUCTIONS: Preparing Samba packages for Solaris

Make sure that your $PATH contains directories /usr/sfw/bin and /usr/ccs/bin

To produce a package:

* Type sh makepkg.sh build

The package will be created in the /tmp directory.

By default, the package will be built to install samba in /opt/samba
To change the default, modify the INSTALL_BASE variable in makepkg.sh
